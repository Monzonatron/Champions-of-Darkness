# Champions-of-Darkness
My Senior Project for Ramapo College in 2012 - I got an A!

Champions of Darkness is a pseudo-Diablo-like game (aRPG) in a raw and amateur form. It was "completed" in about 3-4 months of initial draft and design. It features bad hotbar abilities, gimmicky looting, light rpg mechanics, and a chat system to keep yourself and only yourself company. I love it!

# Requirements
This project requires Microsoft XNA 4.0 Redistributable to run the executable file. The project has an incompatible version with my Visual Studio and therefore I cannot compile it - but a separate download is available.


# About
This is the Senior Project I wrote based off of a Design Document proposal to the professor at the beginning of the course. From there, the game was created in accordance with the design document with about a 91% completion across a four month period. Unimplemented was a proposed multiplayer system (though enough to open the ports and allow a connection, along with a chatting system is implemented). For this project I went into the XNA Library Blind, having to learn whatever necessary to get my project going.

I worked very hard on this project and am proud of what I was able to accomplish, though I would love to fix some problems and logistical errors in the game (most notably enemy AI and player abilities). However I have decided to leave it untouched.

Artwork that does not look like it was done by a toddler in MSPaint is not created by me and a WorksCited.txt file is in one of the folders pointing to the authors of the artwork. I do not take credit for any music and most artwork. This project is not for sale and was only submitted to my College and Github for research purposes. Thank you to the creators and to XNAChat (http://xnachat.com/) for their close-knit community and assistance when I was at wit's end.

# Controls
I have no idea, seriously.
I booted it up and took a look: Xbox controller works as primary input, Right Trigger is to Attack primary, the four buttons use alternate abilities (some abilities are buffs and have no visual cue). D-Pad and Left Stick work as movement. Tab to get out of the inventory menu, escape possibly closes the game or opens inventory, so does tab. Enter allows input into chat.
